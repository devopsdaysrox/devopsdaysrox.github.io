      <h1>Dave Hahn (Netflix) - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/relix42" target="_blank">@relix42</a></h1>
      <h2>How Netflix Thinks About DevOps</h2>
      <p>
        Netflix is considered a large DevOps environment. However, 'DevOps' isn't something that Netflix talks much about. If it's so key to the success of the organization, why don't we hear more about it?

Netflix considers DevOps to be a result of our rigorous adherence to our culture not a starting point to create a healthy environment. This talk is a look at our culture, our tools, and how we do things.
      </p>

      <h1>Courtney Kissler (Nordstrom) - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ladyhock" target="_blank">@ladyhock</a></h1>
      <h2>Living in a Hybrid World</h2>
      <p>
        Large, traditional enterprises are adopting DevOps at an accelerating rate. This will soon be the new normal and those behind the curve will find themselves unable to effectively adapt to inevitable changes in customer expectations and at a disadvantage for attracting top talent.

At Nordstrom, we have the challenge common amongst our peers of transforming a large enterprise to a new way of thinking about how to deliver software.

We have legacy applications, legacy technology, and legacy mindsets.

In this talk, I will share how we are approaching this problem with a case study about our eCommerce platform (both legacy and modern) and what we are doing to address living in a hybrid world.
      </p>

      <h1>Alan Robertson (Assimilation Systems) - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/OSSAlanR" target="_blank">@OSSAlanR</a></h1>
      <h2>Security Automation for DevOps</h2>
      <p>
        Making your systems more secure is a daunting task - the average system has something like 100 ways it’s out of step with hardening best practices. If you have 1000 systems, that means you have something like 100,000 issues - it’s overwhelming! There’s also understanding your attack surface (the ways an intruder can enter your systems) - how to understand and minimize it.
      </p>
    <p>
This talk will cover these things:
<ul>
<li>How to know what you need to do to harden your systems</li>
<li>How to triage, manage and measure your hardening process - and show your boss what great progress you’re making.</li>
<li>How to keep your systems hardened after you get there.</li>
<li>How to visualize and understand your attack surface</li>
</ul>
      </p>

      <h1>"Waldo" Grunenwald - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gwaldo" target="_blank">@gwaldo</a></h1>
      <h2>Fear and Loathing in Systems Administration</h2>
      <p>
        "DevOps Doesn't Work." Whether it's from people who's "DevOps Transformation" consisted of a renaming, or people who scoffed at the idea of letting development deploy to Prod _more_ often, I hear this all the time. And frankly, I'm tired of "What is DevOps" talks.

DevOps is a strawmanperson. When a SysAdmin says "DevOps doesn't work" or grumbles about giving access to Production to people, the real problem is that historically they have been outnumbered, overridden, and have not had authority aligned with responsibility.

In this talk, I will demonstrate why DevOps doesn't matter, and that focusing on DevOps is missing the point.
</p>
<p>
I will offer practical solutions to:
<ul>
<li>the problems of historically poor relations with other teams</li>
<li>All of the responsiblity, none of the authority</li>
<li>Tragically slim Systems / Ops teams</li>
<li>Constant Firefighting</li>
</ul>
      </p>

      <h1>Leon Fayer (OmniTI) - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/papafire" target="_blank">@papa_fire</a></h1>
      <h2>Production testing through monitoring</h2>
      <p>
         Identifying and fixing issues in new code before deploying it to production is important for every software development cycle. However, relying on traditional testing methods in the age of Internet-scale data driven problems may prove to be incomplete. Identifying and fixing the issues in production quickly is crucial, but it requires insight into usage patterns and trends across the whole architecture and application logic. In this talk I will provide practical examples of inefficiencies of some of the most common testing methods and offer recommendations on metric instrumentation to help DevOps organizations with identifying and acting on business-effecting problems. This talk presents practical examples of ineffectiveness of individual testing methods and provides recommendations on instrumentation of monitoring coverage to detect and remedy production problems and anomalies.

      <h2>Gokart to Grand Prix: How It Feels To Actually Go Fast</h2>
      <p>
         A lot of engineering organizations believe they’ve assembled a great software development system - they’ve used containers in all the right places, they’ve brought in the best-in-class, modular automation tools, they’ve cranked the Jenkins knob to 11, and they’re achieving velocities never before imagined. However, after a few euphoric laps around the track, reality sets in: “This velocity is now the norm... What’s next?" Can we make this thing go any faster? Because I think seeing is better than believing, this presentation will illuminate the differences in the “feel” of the operation of a PaaS built on container primitives like CoreOS, Etcd, Docker, et. al versus what it’s like to build the same opinionated PaaS on top of an unopinionated PaaS like Kubernetes. The stories, demos, and points made in this presentation come from first hand experience in replatforming Deis v1 (using Docker primitives) to Deis v2 (approaching the same goal but with Kubernetes native principles).

      <h1>Jess Breckenridge (Ping Identity) - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jbreck" target="_blank">@jbreck</a></h1>
      <h2>Pilot your Project: Avoiding anti-patterns while handling incidents and planning</h2>
      <p>
        To understand anti-patterns and how they are created, we must first understand the limits of peoples ability to deal with information. The human mind can only do so much:
      </p>
<ul>
<li>It can process about 4 bits of information per second</li>
<li>Working memory is 7 chunks, pieces of information at a time</li>
<li>The average mind can only handle an abstraction of 3 levels of splay, or hierarchy at a time</li>
</ul>
<p>
Based on these limits, we should never design projects or procedures that violate these rules without good reason. Avoiding anti-patterns also requires us make sound decisions. Sound decision making is more than just gut instinct. It requires avoiding common errors that lead to bad decisions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Perceptual Errors</li>
<li>Procedural Errors</li>
<li>Decision Errors</li>
</ul>
<p>
During the talk, we work at understanding these limitations and errors. You will be able to handle incidents better, and get better results from your projects.
      </p>

      <h2>Leading grassroots organizational change</h2>
      <p>
        Leading change is hard. Very often there's a perspective that you need to have a title to lead change. I believe that the ability to lead change is in all of us and that a title isn't necessary to build support, empathy, and drive for change in an organization. Beyond being possible, there are some distinct advantages to leading as a peer to others. In this talk I'll cover what I believe are the important considerations when leading change of any kind, and what special advantages and disadvantages you have when leading change as an individual contributor. My high level guidelines are:
      </p>
<ul>
<li>Change is hard, don't be a jerk about it</li>
<li>Consider what your proposed change says about the things already in place</li>
<li>Be sensitive and aware that you might not fully understand why things are as they are - seek to learn</li>
<li>Consider how your change impacts the influence others presently have</li>
<li>Change is hard, it takes time, be patient with yourself and others</li>
</ul>
<p>
I will talk about why change sometimes doesn't work and what you can do to understand the present environment. I will also talk about how you can approach the phases of a change from learning, to prototype, and into implementation, socialization, and scale. Most importantly, I'll cover how to do this without destroying your willingness to do it again in the future, and focus on how to make sure you implement change that others can adopt and own.

      <h2>The Next Big Borrow - Software Supply Chain Automation</h2>
      <p>
        In almost every market, software has become critical. Software is how we display our innovation and establish a competitive advantage. We see this at Uber, who have disrupted the taxi industry without owning any cars. They do it all with software. Dollar Shave Club have used their software to create a better customer experience and disrupt the razor industry. To deliver software at the pace of innovation, apps are no longer written, they are assembled with prewritten components.

The software development process has evolved into one that closely resembles the assembly lines of traditional hard good. This reliance on 3rd party components has made the quality of each component a priority. Most companies lack visibility into the quality of the component they use and regularly introduce security and license risk into their applications without knowing. Many ignore component quality until they are faced with a "must fix" emergency.

The problem becomes one of inventory management and is addressed by following 3 supply chain principals.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use fewer and better suppliers</li>
<li>Use only the best of their products</li>
<li>Track what you use and where</li>
</ul>
<p>
By embracing these principals you bring hygiene and discipline to your supply chain which will:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce costly rework caused by low quality components</li>
<li>Reduce "break/fix" emergencies that "stop the line"</li>
<li>Reduce the time to diagnose and fix the problem when such emergencies can't be avoided</li>
</ul>
<p>
How's your software supply chain?

      <h2>Crisis Communication Breakdown</h2>
      <p>
        Our process for communicating during an outage is most definitely a work in process, which is common for many startups at our stage. But when you’re talking about handling the alerts of our customers, we need to be especially sensitive of how and when we inform our stakeholders about an outage.

In this talk, I’ll share a few of the things we’ve learned in our journey to be better at connecting with our customers during a firefight.
<ul>
<li>Crisis Communication is scary! but your customers will reward honesty, candor and timeliness with loyalty</li>
<li>Buy-in: you need it at the top and at the bottom</li>
People need to agree on:
<ul>
    <li>What gets communicated</li>
    <li>Who is managing the message</li>
    <li>Where the message is getting shared (key accounts, Twitter, StatusPage...)</li>
    <li>When, and how often, alerts and updates go out</li>
</ul>
<li>We have a cross-functional Crisis Communication team that gets pulled into incidents as they occur</li>
<li>Members of the Crisis Communication team attend “official” crisis communication training & get certified</li>
<li>We manage Crisis Communication during a firefight without disrupting the critical workflow o Crisis Communication can help troubleshooting in a firefight, by ensuring that everyone involved has the same understanding of symptoms and causes</li>
<li>This is DevOps:</li>
<ul>
    <li>We retrospect, iterate, and make continuous process improvements</li>
    <li>We do cross-functional post-mortems, so developers have an awareness of Crisis Communication and vice-versa</li>
    <li>We use ChatOps and our own toolset to get the Crisis Communication team involved during incidents</li>
</ul>
</ul>

      <h2>Summon: Secrets and source control</h2>
      <p>
        Working for Conjur and talking with lot of people about embedding security into their development workflows, I noticed a gap in tooling that made working with secrets difficult. There are many problems with the relationship between security and development and operations teams; tooling shouldn't be one of them.

So I started work on an open-source file format and tool to make tracking and working with secrets easier (secrets.yml and Summon). It features pluggable providers to people can try out different secrets providers without reworking their entire workflow.

The project has started to gain some attention, and I'd like to share it with more people.

      <h2>Go Rin No Sho - What DevOps can learn from a 17th century samurai</h2>
      <p>
         No part of this talk will be about "ninjas" or use the word "ninja" or any of those silly parallels. Miyamoto Musashi teaches a broad approach to strategy, and cleanly delineates strategic from tactical thinking. He encourages Masters to be practical apprentices in all disciplines. His world, while infinitely different from ours, led him to a perspective on strategy that we find direct comparisons with in our modern DevOps practices. While his thinking was informed by the direct experience of brutal conflict, ours is... well also informed by years of brutal conflict in the old ways of running IT and Ops. Come listen to a 400 year old sage validate and agree with the strategic decisions we, as a DevOps community, have made. And see one picture of a cool sword.

      <h2>Critical Incident? WTF (What’s the format)? - Minimum Viable Runbooks</h2>
      <p>
        A Minimum Viable Runbook is the blended idea between the concepts of minimum viable product delivery and the usage of Runbooks in an IT operations setting. After defining Minimum Viable Runbook (MVR), we'll quickly get into the WHY and then the HOW.
       <p>
        WHY
      </p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving your teams an easy process to implement runbooks in a "lean" approach</li>
<li>Paving the way for better runbooks usage and creation</li>
<li>Making it easier for you teams to respond to critical incidents</li>
<li>Saving brain cycles for your team members when incidents occurs</li>
<li>Giving your teams confidence</li>
</ul>
<p>
HOW
</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage trending technologies and mindsets for how we can begin to create these MVRs</li>
<li>Components to consider when building your first MVR</li>
<li>Leveraging your existing tools and documentation Runbooks are CRITICALLY important for every incident management strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
They are often not implemented and/or overlooked. Using Minimum Viable Runbooks makes it easy to start implementing runbooks before it's too late.

      <h2>Meet AnsibleDK: Yes, That’s a Thing Now</h2>
      <p>
         Are you a cow, a pet, a canary, or a unicorn? Ansible calls itself the “batteries included” configuration management tool. But when you’re treating infrastructure as code, you need a real software development lifecycle - with syntax checking, linters, test frameworks and other such utilities. Installing these things is a pain - requiring both a Ruby and a Python runtime and horrid dependency chains in each space - and you want as few barriers to entry as possible. Borrowing heavily from the inspiration (and toolchain!) behind ChefDK, AnsibleDK delivers all the goodies in one easily managed OS package. Just install, run one command to enter an AnsibleDK context, and everything “just works” - so you can focus on convincing that grumpy service to start reliably, deploying the latest glibc patch, or just enjoying life.

      <h2>A DevOps Necessary Evil: Marketing</h2>
      <p>
        Before you start your pilot, think about it a bit with your newly assembled DevOps team; what are the biggest pains you face in your roles, what do you think you can actively work together to change during the pilot
<ul>
<li>Put down on paper what those bottlenecks are, how long things currently take and how many people are involved
<li>Measure and track progress during your pilot - have a 5 minute stand up daily to talk about what is going well, what is changing and what hasn't, and any quantifiable changes (i.e. it only took an hour to get a VM today to test vs 3 weeks, or whatever)</li>
<li>When your pilot is done and you have a real deliverable to show for it, whether it's a fix pack or a new app, consolidate those metrics and seek out the best 'nuggets' to promote - wherever you can cite the biggest changes</li>
<li>If you need to, get someone from sales or marketing to help you put it together in a way that 'tells a story' - yes, I realize that is a marketing term, but it works when you tell the before and after story in a cohesive manner, dropping in numbers where they make the most impact</li>
<li>If you manage to sell this to your management and they want you to think about broader implications, reach out to some other groups, ask them what problems they are facing, and line those up with any ROI calculations you may have to create those larger/org wide estimates for time or money savings</li>
<li>Don't forget about the emotional aspects of selling this; if you can fathom a guess that the release team might be able to avoid x weekends in the office, you can include the implications for their home life, job satisfaction and any other qualitative factors along with the time and risk reduction (management usually wants to keep reliable, hardworking people there)</li>

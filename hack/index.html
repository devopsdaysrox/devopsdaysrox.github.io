  <p>  Launch a Startup in a Weekend, perhaps an Internet of Things (IoT) Startup.</p>
  <p>  Join us at Startup Weekend Denver 7 with Internet of Things (IoT) May 20-22, 2016</p>
  <p>  This event gives you the opportunity to launch a startup in a weekend's time, maybe an IoT Startup. Like every Startup Weekend, you'll meet amazing people, enjoy great food, and have an experience working like you've never worked before.</p>
  <p>  Our goal is to create an environment where passionate people can come together to get things done; to learn, network, bridge the gap between trades, expose potential, and see actual results. Coaches will be available throughout the weekend to guide you in creating your startup. We are proud to be a part of this type of innovative collaboration and we hope you will join this global movement.</p>
  <p>  Startup Weekend has held 2000+ events in 135+ countries around the world, and we are looking forward to making a big dent in Denver. With the help of local supporters, we are planning to leverage our global reach to impact our local community.  The event will be held on Friday, May 20th, 2016 through Sunday, May 22nd, 2016 and we are confirming a venue in Denver.</p>
  <p>  IoT provides massive opportunities for the next generation of entrepreneurs, be one of them!</p>

			<h2>Jsonnet, Terraform & Packer</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>member of the academic programming languages community with
many top conference publications.  He began his career with a theory PhD from
Imperial College London where he developed static type systems and program
analysis techniques for safe concurrency in OO languages.  He then joined the
X10 team at IBM TJ Watson Research Center, developing the X10 language,
source-to-source compiler and runtime.  This work included a GPU compiler
backend, many contributions to the C++ backend, maintenance of the compiler's
frontend type system and leading the Resilient X10 project, which allowed X10
programs to tolerate node failures.

For the last 18 months, Dave is a member of Google's Technical Infrastructure
division, applying his programming languages experience to cluster management
and service configuration tools, both directly on Google's internal
infrastructure and for its public Cloud Platform.  Dave is active in the open
source community, contributing to Terraform's Google Compute Engine provider.
He designed and built the Jsonnet configuration language as a Google 20%
project.

As a hobby, he is the founder and lead developer of the Grit Game Engine project
and its spinoff -- a scripted image manipulation framework called LuaImg. </p>

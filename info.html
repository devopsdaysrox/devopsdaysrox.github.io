			<h2>The conference that brings development and operations together</h2>
			<p>DevOpsDays is a technical conference, aimed at developers, sysadmins and anyone else involved in technology, whether expert or beginner.</p>
			<p>Truth is, agile techniques used in development have an impact on the way operations organizes its work. Similarly, operations and sysadmins are becoming programmers because of the virtualization and automation trend where everything is managed through an API.</p>
			<p>We’re excited to help bring this fantastic event to the Rocky Mountain region April 23 & 24, 2015.</p>

Crisis Communication Breakdown

IGNITE

Our process for communicating during an outage is most definitely a work in process, which is common for many startups at our stage. But when you’re talking about handling the alerts of our customers, we need to be especially sensitive of how and when we inform our stakeholders about an outage. In this Ignite talk, I’ll share a few of the things we’ve learned in our journey to be better at connecting with our customers during a firefight. •	Crisis Communication is scary! but your customers will reward honesty, candor and timeliness with loyalty •	Buy-in: you need it at the top and at the bottom.  People need to agree on: o	What gets communicated o	Who is managing the message o Where the message is getting shared (key accounts, Twitter, StatusPage...) o	When, and how often, alerts and updates go out •	We have a cross-functional Crisis Communication team that gets pulled into incidents as they occur •	Members of the Crisis Communication team attend “official” crisis communication training & get certified •	We manage Crisis Communication during a firefight without disrupting the critical workflow o	Crisis Communication can help troubleshooting in a firefight, by ensuring that everyone involved has the same understanding of symptoms and causes • This is DevOps: o	We retrospect, iterate, and make continuous process improvements o	We do cross-functional post-mortems, so developers have an awareness of Crisis Communication and vice-versa o	We use ChatOps and our own toolset to get the Crisis Communication team involved during incidents


Continuous Testing in a DevOps World

30 minute

Accelerating any business process, however, exposes systemic constraints that shackle the entire organization to its slowest moving component. In the case of the accelerated SDLC, testing has become the most significant barrier to taking full advantage of iterative approaches to software development. For organizations to leverage these transformative development strategies, they must shift from test automation to continuous testing. Drawing a distinction between test automation and continuous testing may seem like an exercise in semantics, but the gap between automating a functional test and executing a continuous testing process is substantial.


Go Rin No Sho - What DevOps can learn from a 17th century samurai

IGNITE

No part of this talk will be about "ninjas" or use the word "ninja" or any of those silly parallels. Miyamoto Musashi teaches a broad approach to strategy, and cleanly delineates strategic from tactical thinking. He encourages Masters to be practical apprentices in all disciplines. His world, while infinitely different from ours, led him to a perspective on strategy that we find direct comparisons with in our modern DevOps practices. While his thinking was informed by the direct experience of brutal conflict, ours is... well also informed by years of brutal conflict in the old ways of running IT and Ops. Come listen to a 400 year old sage validate and agree with the strategic decisions we, as a DevOps community, have made. And see one picture of a cool sword.


NoOps for data science, analytics, and profit

30 minute

Craftsy has been experiencing dramatic growth over the past 5 years putting ever increasing strain on organizational resources, and we've had to get creative with how to meet the growing needs of the business without increasing spend in headcount or software. Thus, NoOps, or LoOps has been an area of increasing focus for the team. Enabling our developers to quickly bring solutions to bear on business opportunity is a huge leverage for our business, and we think we've really unlocked something with Lambda. Lambda, Cloud Functions, Swift, and Iron.io all represent the next generation of PaaS, and likely the future of computing. These event based application execution frameworks leapfrog the container revolution entirely and fully abstract compute, network, and storage resources from the developer or administrator. This enables a highly scalable, resilient approach to application delivery that effectively removes configuration management, system or container administration, and many of the other resource drains present in standard Ops environments. With Data Science and Data processing as our leading use cases, Craftsy has built out some impressive pipelines requiring zero administrative overhead and time, and costing less than a Team Pizza Lunch.


Living in a Hybrid World

30 minute

Large, traditional enterprises are adopting DevOps at an accelerating rate. This will soon be the new normal, those behind the curve will find themselves unable to effectively adapt to inevitable changes in customer expectations and at a disadvantage for attracting top talent. We have the challenge, common amongst our peers, of transforming a large enterprise to a new way of thinking about how to deliver software. We have legacy applications, legacy technology, and legacy mindsets. In this talk, I will share how we are approaching this problem with a case study about our eCommerce platform (both legacy and modern) and what we are doing to address living in a hybrid world.

The $270 Billion Software Hygiene Opportunity

30 minute

Over the last 20 years, the three most significant innovations in software development have centered on waste reduction and efficiency gains, with a continual quest to deliver better software, faster. Agile and lean have optimized development planning and execution, the open source movement has lead to extensive re-use and DevOps is continuously streamlining the delivery of value. Ironically, in this persistent quest for speed, we have been taking on a lot more technical debt than anyone would expect. The software development discipline is going faster than it ever has, yet it is still being restrained from its full potential due to a broad lack of information associated with the vast array of open source building blocks that are used to build today's applications. Without this information, we tend not only to use lesser quality parts but to use more and different kinds of them, adding significant amounts of unnecessary complexity into the mix. This talk will show how some not so obvious changes in thinking can drive startling gains in application development efficiency and waste reduction by making better choices, earlier within your application stack. This better hygiene leads to less complexity, less risk and a lot less waste -- $270 billion less.

GameDays @Ping Identity

30 minute

In this talk, I will run through both the philosophical reasons for exercising a GameDay event, and how we communicate the benefits to our large enterprise customers. This is our third full year doing GameDay testing against our corporate and production infrastructure, and we've seen many improvements to both our culture and our systems.


Redefining systems development lifecycle for the age of DevOps

30 minute

As application systems become more and more complex and move to the online domain, the traditional systems development life cycle (SDLC) becomes a hinderance to the evolving world of as-a-service models. As business models shift, so should the processes around them in order to optimize for new workflows and put tech groups, and companies as a whole, in the best position to respond to new challenges. Traditional SDLS cannot satisfy the response and flexibility demands of the online business, forcing organization to evaluate their internal processes and workflows. DevOps philosophy, and associated toolchain, provide a platform for greatly improving both software delivery and helping to align business processes to support a more dynamic business model. The aim of this talk is to discuss the bottlenecks of the traditional SDLC and to show the application of DevOps principals to improve effectiveness and efficiency of system development and management. The goal is to talk through the traditional life cycle, giving examples of outdated techniques (like code freezes and scheduled deployments) and offer tips on implementing techniques and processes to help streamline continuous delivery.


Blue-Green Deployments using Terraform + Packer + Jenkins

30 minute

One of the highlights of the DevOps movement has been an exciting embrace of change brought on by new and interesting toolchains. This presentation will cover one of the most interesting examples of the marriage between DevOps, tools, and cloud -- the Blue-Green deployment style. Our presentation will begin with a short description of Craftsy's original deployment style and the challenges it presented that took us in a new, exciting direction. We'll continue to discuss challenges along the way and how we utilized fascinating new tools to get us to where we wanted to be.

Pilot your Project: Avoiding anti-patterns while handling incidents and planning.

30 minute  

To understand anti-patterns and how they are created, we must first understand the limits of peoples ability to deal with information. The human mind can only do so much: - It can process about 4 bits of information per second. - Working memory is 7 chunks, pieces of information at a time. - The average mind can only handle an abstraction of 3 levels of splay, or hierarchy at a time. Based on these limits, we should never design projects or procedures that violate these rules without good reason. Avoiding anti-patterns also requires us make sound decisions. Sound decision making is more than just gut instinct. It requires avoiding common errors that lead to bad decisions: - Perceptual Errors. - Procederual Errors. - Decision Errors. During the talk, we work at understanding these limitations and errors. You will be able to handle incidents better, and get better results from your projects.

Critical Incident? WTF (What’s the format)? - Minimum Viable Runbooks

IGNITE  

A Minimum Viable Runbook is the blended idea between the concepts of minimum viable product delivery and the usage of Runbooks in an IT operations setting. After defining Minimum Viable Runbook (MVR), we'll quickly get into the WHY and then the HOW. WHY -Giving your teams an easy process to implement runbooks in a "lean" approach -Paving the way for better runbooks usage and creation -Making it easier for you teams to respond to critical incidents -Saving brain cycles for your team members when incidents occurs -Giving your teams confidence HOW -Leverage trending technologies and mindsets for how we can begin to create these MVRs -Components to consider when building your first MVR -Leveraging your existing tools and documentation Runbooks are CRITICALLY important for every incident management strategy. They are often not implemented and/or overlooked. Using Minimum Viable Runbooks makes it easy to start implementing runbooks before it's too late.

Gokart to Grand Prix: How It Feels To Actually Go Fast

30 minute

A lot of engineering organizations believe they’ve assembled a great software development system - they’ve used containers in all the right places, they’ve brought in the best-in-class, modular automation tools, they’ve cranked the Jenkins knob to 11, and they’re achieving velocities never before imagined. However, after a few euphoric laps around the track, reality sets in: “This velocity is now the norm... What’s next?" Can we make this thing go any faster? Because I think seeing is better than believing, this presentation will illuminate the differences in the “feel” of the operation of a PaaS built on container primitives like CoreOS, Etcd, Docker, et. al versus what it’s like to build the same opinionated PaaS on top of an unopinionated PaaS like Kubernetes. The stories, demos, and points made in this presentation come from first hand experience in replatforming Deis v1 (using Docker primitives) to Deis v2 (approaching the same goal but with Kubernetes native principles).


On Call for Developers

IGNITE  

With emergence of DevOps approach to application development, deployment and management developers get more and more involved in day-to-day system operations. Lately, there has been a popular point of view that developers should be included in on call rotation on equal grounds with sys admins. While developer-centric approach to production management is a welcome change from traditional ways, one must fully understand the extent of oncall responsibilities before making a business decision to change. In this talk I'll walk through different aspects of operational oncall responsibilities and discuss ways in which developers should (and should not) be involved in operation of production systems.


Production testing through monitoring

30 minute

Identifying and fixing issues in new code before deploying it to production is important for every software development cycle. However, relying on traditional testing methods in the age of Internet-scale data driven problems may prove to be incomplete. Identifying and fixing the issues in production quickly is crucial, but it requires insight into usage patterns and trends across the whole architecture and application logic. In this talk I will provide practical examples of inefficiencies of some of the most common testing methods and offer recommendations on metric instrumentation to help DevOps organizations with identifying and acting on business-effecting problems. This talk presents practical examples of ineffectiveness of individual testing methods and provides recommendations on instrumentation of monitoring coverage to detect and remedy production problems and anomalies.

Applying Ansible

This talk will focus on the practical use of Ansible to automate provisioning of Linux environments. The talk with introduce Ansible terminology, the structure of a playbook, the importance of roles, and the Ansible Galaxy. The talk will also touch on the challenges and benefits of moving away from hand-crafted configurations and moving toward automated provisioning. At the completion of the talk attendees will have a better idea of how to get started with Ansible and what they can expect to achieve in a very short timeframe.
In my role I develop lab pods for students in a training environment. Each course developer builds their lab environment by hand, and later must provision multiple instances of this environment for students. Handbuilt environments tend to be fragile and are difficult to reproduce, so developers can not leverage the work of their peers to build and deliver reliable environments quickly. This is very similar to the challenges of the developer moving apps and environments into testing, staging, and production.
Learn the techniques we are using to build our Ansible playbooks, and how they are helping us to be more productive, and to develop more reproducible environments.

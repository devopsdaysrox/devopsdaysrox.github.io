<h1>DevOpsDays</h1>
<p>
Denver is hosting it's 2nd annual DevOpsDays event this April 21st & 22nd (Thursday & Friday). Taking place again at the Fortrust Data Center, in the North River (RiNo) District of downtown Denver. Named DevOpsDays - Rockies to amplify a focus of inclusion of all those in the Software Delivery space.  Attendees, sponsors, speakers, and organizers hail from all over the Front Range and beyond.

<h2>What?</h2>
<p>
DevOpsDays are grass-roots events taking place in cities all around the world. It is organized entirely by volunteers and enthusiasts of DevOps philosophies, processes, and tools who are excited to be a part of the movement. Built on empathy and a strong desire to want to help spread valuable information about modern software delivery to others in their community, DevOpsDaysDays events are growing not only in size but number of communities globally.  Most events are 2-days, but many cities host single-day events.

Regardless of the size, these events generally consist of 4 primary speakers each morning, presenting 25 to 30 minute talks. Presentations range from cultural ideas to specific details and experiences implementing and managing a broad spectrum of DevOps and Agile related issues. Additionally, 5 or 6 IGNITE style talks (5 minute auto-advancing slides) take place each day providing a good mix of content delivered quickly and on point.

The last part of each event consists of "Open Spaces". These self-suggested and self-run discussions provide an open forum for participants to engage in deeper and meaningful conversations with their peers, presenters, and vendors. Discussions are often extensions of points and ideas brought up in early presentations, but can be about any subject interesting to a participant.

Although not a requirement of DevOpsDays events, most cities commonly host a social event the evening of the first day. This provides a space for all to engage in discussions about the topics brought up at the event as well as network and enjoy food and beverage unique to the local community.

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
Why should you attend a DevOpsDays event? If you or your company is involved in building, delivering, maintaining, or supporting software, this event is specifically for you.

Speakers, vendors, and participants are passionate about these topics and love to share what they know with those eager to collaborate and learn.

Most who participate in DevOpsDays events will come away learning about new ideas and tools. More importantly, they will come away armed with a new-found motivation to implement change within their teams and organizations. The transformation towards a DevOps philosophy is often stalled out quickly due in large part to "old-view" ways of managing tasks and collaborating on innovative ways to delivery and support new tools & services.

DevOpsDays will give participants the language, motivation, and courage to drive the cultural and technological changes many of us recognize we desperately need in our organizations. With a broad range of topics and discussions from participants, speakers, organizers, and vendors, no other event provides this level of information, interaction, and value.   


A non-exhaustive list of topics typically presented on and discussed at these events are:

- Continuous Delivery
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- Automation
- Configuration Management
- Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting
- Metrics and Visualization
- Source Code Management
- Provisioning

<h2>Who?</h2>
<p>
Who will you meet at DevOpsDays? Those who organize these events are very involved in the local DevOps and Agile community and love to bring people together to discuss topics related to the movements. Practitioners of tools and processes that speed up the delivery of software and help keep it highly-stable and highly-available come together to share what they've learned along the way.

Presenters will be there to share both anecdotal and empirical evidence to support why the DevOps philosophies have helped bring greater value to IT and businesses around the world. Well seasoned speakers and "thought leaders" in the DevOps space, as well as local experts who have dedicated their career to understanding and sharing the best of the best in both process and tooling will help jump start your ideas and conversations. From there participants will steer the conversations in a direction that best serves them and the challenges they are currently facing.

Vendors from all corners of the world will be on site to explain how they fit in to the DevOps Universe as well as offer tips and tricks to solve the problems participants are dealing with.  An exhibitor hall allows participants to visit with and exchange in dialogue throughout the event, but while presentations are taking place, all in attendance (including vendors) are encouraged to listen in on the talks and save the conversations for another time.

Last, your peers will be on-site. Often proving to be the best resources, those who live and work in your community will engage in conversations to expand your mind and motivation to bring about the change in your team and organization that you seek. Once the event has concluded, locals can continue the conversations at future meetups and gatherings.

</h2>Day of the Event</h2>
<p>
As you make your way through talks and ideas, remember that learning and understand DevOps and the ideas and methodologies that it brings is a spiral path.

We will circle through some ideas over and over and over and over. Each time at a different level. There's no such thing as being "done with DevOps".  Frustration and rewards are found along each level on the path.

This event is full of very smart people. All of you are experts in what you do but are hungry to learn more.
This event is testament to it. You wouldn't be spending your entire day at a small, little-known, grass roots event if you weren't. I promise you that.

Furthermore, many of you know quite a bit about this DevOps stuff. You've been practicing it in some form or another for a while.  Some of the old-schoolers in attendance may find yourself thinking "Ohhhhhhhhhhh... that's all DevOps is?  I've been doing that for years!  Rookies."  

However, for the next two days... Give yourself permission to be a beginner again.

And those of you in here that already "Get it".  Empathy is a one of the biggest parts of this whole thing. Share what you know. Clarify questions from others here who have them. Be an agent of change, not only in your own company, but for our community in general.  We're all looking to get better.

To us here in the great state of Colorado.. we look outside and see mountains to over come.  Physical and symbolical mountains.

Within those peaks are challenging trails exploding in all directions.

The aim of DevOpsDays Rockies is to find the trail, establish our footing, and begin the climb.

Progress not Perfection!


We can't wait to see you at the event!
